        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Grace Lee and I am a business major. I am currently a first year studenta at UCR. I am from Wichita Kansas. My overall goal is to become an immigration lawyer and help people around the world.<br><br>

        With background with immigration law I have been aspiriing to learn and connect more with other immigration attornies. I want to broaden my education and expereince to grow as not only a person but a lawyer. I want to go to law school in either Kansas or California to futher my education after college. <br><br>

       I am both a group and individual learner and can adapt to any surroundings. With my mom being an immigration lawyer at the moment I want to follow in her footsteps. I like photography, traveling, and spending time with friends. I played tennis in high school which helped me learn how to become a team player and leader. When i was a senior I was put into the position of mentoring the younger kids which helped shape my leadership skills. Coming into college, I was scared because I didnt know anyone or anything about the surroundings,however, with preserverance and hard work, I found a way to enjoy my life here. I have also experienced different study opportunties. Over senior year summer, i went to korea as a foreing exchange student. I went to a school in the middle of Seoul called Sogang University and studied Korean with fellow classmates. Although the thought of doing school in the summer was not ideal, it was very eye opening to see such a different culture. This program also allowed me to explore Korea as a country. I first hand experienced a whole different culture which allowed me to become more open minded. It also allowed me to make several connections with poeple from all around the world. Since where I was staying, Hongdae, is a densely foreinger populated area, it was easy to make friends with anyone I came into contact with. To this day, i am still in contact with many of my classmates. It also pushed me to learn my parents native lanauge. It allowed me to communicate better with my grandparents and see them for the first time in a while. Experiencing such a different culture allowed me to grow as a person since it pushed me out of my comfort zone. After this experince, I flew back to Korea again in the Winter and had a blast. I am planning on doing another program this summer to better my korean communication skills. Next year for teh spring semsester i am planning on doing a study abraod program in Spain. Because I want to beocme an immigration laywer, I want to be abe to speak and understand Spanish. Since the majority of immigrants are coming from spanish speaking communities, learning spanish will give me an upperhand where i wouldnt need to invest in translators to save both money and time. Studying abraod in Spain will also allow me to travel and explore rest of Europe where I have never been before. Although I am scared to go to a new enviroement for such a long time, I connect it wiht my trup to korea.I'm scared at the moment but once it is over I know I will not regret it.
